# Discord Tavern Style Chatbot for KoboldCpp with LLaMA based chat models
This is a discord bot that connects to a KoboldAI endpoint and uses the Pygmalion style chat prompt system to communicate back and forth. It supports TavernAI cards and jsons.

I have made the following changes from the original repo by ausboss:

> Changed the variables to be submitted in the prompt post request. It appears that this is the preferred way for KoboldCpp to work

> Tweaked the variables to be LLaMA model compatible.

> Introduced sentencepiece tokenisation of messages, as to feed the correct amount of tokens to koboldcpp. This change essentially adds support for the new RoPE scaling, as context size will be correctly handled by the bot.

> Improved support for models not strictly trained on the Pyg dataset by detecting and trimming cases where the model starts hallucinating what users say to it without making new lines.

> Some code tweaks to reduce repetition

> A few new slash commands for my convenience when testing

I've done most of my testing and development with Manticore-13B. I have tried Pygmalion-13B with good results too.

| Sync Commands  | `/sync`          | Needed to make the commands appear right away.                                         |
| Reload Cog     | `/reload <name>` | Lets you reload a specific cog instead of needing to restart everything.               |
|Regenerate Last Message| `/regenerate`| Removes the last message and will generate another one                |
| Follow up      | `/followup`      | Tell the bot to generate another message on top of the last one it sent  |
| Reset Conversation | `/reset_conversation` | Erases the current conversation and returns the context window to a clean slate. |
| Enable Multiline | `/enable_multiline_response` | Allows the bot to reply with multiple lines. Can get more information, but generation will take longer and can have more opportunity for hallucinations |
| Disable Multiline | `/disable_multiline_response` | If multiline response is enabled, disable it so the bot only replies with a single paragraph/sentence |
